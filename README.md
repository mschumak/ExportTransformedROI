This plugin is designed to copy regions of interest from one image to another as it is shown in the image below. It also takes into account any transformations used to align the source and the target images.

## Notes
This plugin works with images with different sizes and resolutions. ** Currently if the images have different resolutions, the target image must not have any transformations.** The ability of working with the transformed target images when the source and target images have different resolutions will be incorporated in the next version of the plugin.
